# Pixela HTTP Requests 

This code is provided as part of the 37th day of the 100 days of coding in Python challenge and is intended for learning purposes only.

## Description

This code snippet is part of a 100-day coding challenge in Python and serves as an exploration of HTTP requests, focusing on GET, POST, and PUT methods. 

The code interacts with the Pixela API, a service enabling users to create custom graphs and track various data points over time.

## Usage
1. Replace placeholders `USERNAME` and `TOKEN` with your Pixela username and token respectively.
2. Modify the `GRAPH_ID` variable to your desired graph ID.
3. Uncomment the appropriate HTTP requests (`POST` requests for creating a user and a graph, and a `PUT` request for adding data to the graph).
4. Execute the script to interact with the Pixela API.

## Note
Ensure that you have an active internet connection and access to the Pixela API.
